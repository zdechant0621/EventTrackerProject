# ===City Shot Glass Tracker===

# ===Overview===

The point of this tracker is to be able to track all the cities I've traveled to and whether or not I bought a shot glass representing that city to add to my collection.


# Development

As a huge advocate of traveling, and someone who got to travel a lot to different places via my previous job, I developed a love of collecting shot glasses for places I've been. I'm not exactly sure where it started, but over the years I collected hundreds of them and display them in a case to showcase all my travels.
